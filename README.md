# Reference Library

A reference library is an element of an architecture repository that records guidelines, templates, patterns, and other forms of reference material that can be used in order to support the creation of new architectures.

The material in this reference library is authored for use by the Scottish Government's Digital Transformation Division but is based on general best practice and will likely be useful in other contexts too.

Sections available:

- [Guidance](./guidance);
- [Reference Models](./reference-models);
- [Templates](./templates).
